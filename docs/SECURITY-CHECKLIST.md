# Security Checklist for Public Repository

This checklist ensures the GravyPrompts codebase is secure for public release.

## âœ… Completed Security Tasks

### 1. **Environment Files**

- [x] `.env` and `.env.local` are in `.gitignore`
- [x] Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
- [x] Created `.env.local.example` with placeholder values
- [x] Removed personal email addresses from examples
- [x] All sensitive values use placeholders (XXXXXXXXX)

### 2. **Debug Scripts**

- [x] Created `scripts/.gitignore` to exclude sensitive scripts
- [x] Created example versions without hardcoded values:
  - `debug-templates.example.js`
  - `get-auth-token.example.js`
- [x] Scripts with hardcoded production URLs are gitignored

### 3. **CI/CD Security**

- [x] Updated GitHub Actions to use OIDC instead of IAM users
- [x] No long-term AWS credentials stored anywhere
- [x] Only requires `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `AMPLIFY_APP_ID` secrets

### 4. **AWS Resources**

- [x] All AWS resource IDs are parameterized
- [x] Stack names use generic prefixes (GRAVYPROMPTS-\*)
- [x] No hardcoded ARNs or account IDs in code

### 5. **Documentation**

- [x] Created secure CI/CD setup guide using OIDC
- [x] All documentation uses placeholder values
- [x] Sensitive examples are properly redacted

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Secrets in Code**

   - All sensitive values in environment variables
   - Example files use placeholders
   - Debug scripts excluded from repository

2. **OIDC Authentication**

   - No long-term credentials
   - Temporary, auto-rotating tokens
   - Scoped to specific repository/branches

3. **Principle of Least Privilege**

   - IAM policies grant minimal required permissions
   - Resources scoped to specific prefixes
   - Conditions limit service access

4. **Environment Isolation**
   - Local development uses separate configuration
   - Production values never hardcoded
   - Clear separation between environments

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Public Checklist

Before making the repository public, verify:

- [ ] Run `git status` - ensure no uncommitted sensitive files
- [ ] Check `git log` - no commits with sensitive data
- [ ] Verify all `.env*` files are gitignored
- [ ] Confirm debug scripts with URLs are gitignored
- [ ] Test that example files work with placeholders
- [ ] Review this checklist one final time

## ðŸš€ Ready for Public Release

The codebase has been secured and is ready for public release. All sensitive information is properly managed through environment variables and secure CI/CD practices.

### What Contributors Need:

1. Their own AWS account
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
4. Follow setup guides to configure their environment

### Security Maintenance:

- Regularly review and update dependencies
- Monitor for security advisories
- Keep IAM policies up to date
- Review access logs periodically
