# Fix Docker Keychain Password Prompts on macOS 15.5 (M3 MacBook Air)

This guide addresses the persistent issue where macOS repeatedly asks for keychain access permission for `docker-credential-osxkeychain`, even after clicking "Always Allow".

## Problem Description

You're constantly seeing alerts like:

> "docker-credential-osxkeychain wants to use your confidential information stored in 'docker credentials' in your keychain"

This happens repeatedly, requiring password entry multiple times, making Docker usage frustrating on macOS.

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Code Sign the Binary (Most Effective)

The issue often occurs because the binary isn't properly code-signed.

```bash
# Find where docker-credential-osxkeychain is located
which docker-credential-osxkeychain

# Code sign it (replace path if different)
sudo codesign --force --deep -s - /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-osxkeychain
```

**Note:** You might see "internal error in Code Signing sub" errors, but this often still resolves the issue after a restart.

### Solution 2: Manually Add to Keychain Access

1. Open **Keychain Access** (⌘+Space, type "Keychain Access")
2. Search for "docker" in the search bar
3. Find entries like "Docker Credentials" or "index.docker.io"
4. Right-click → "Get Info"
5. Go to "Access Control" tab
6. Click the lock icon and enter password
7. Select "Always allow access by these applications"
8. Click the "+" button and navigate to `/usr/local/bin/docker-credential-osxkeychain`
9. Click "Save Changes"
10. **Restart your Mac** (Important!)

### Solution 3: Disable Keychain Storage (Nuclear Option)

If nothing else works, you can disable the keychain credential helper entirely:

```bash
# Edit Docker config
nano ~/.docker/config.json
```

Change from:

```json
{
  "credsStore": "osxkeychain"
}
```

To:

```json
{
  "credsStore": ""
}
```

**Warning:** This means Docker won't store credentials securely in the keychain.

### Solution 4: Complete Docker Reinstall

Sometimes a fresh install resolves persistent issues:

```bash
# Uninstall Docker Desktop completely
brew uninstall --force docker docker-completion docker-credential-helper
rm -rf ~/.docker
rm -rf ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Docker\ Desktop

# Reinstall
brew install --cask docker
```

### Solution 5: Create a Helper Script (Workaround)

Create a wrapper that automatically handles the credential:

```bash
# Create script directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/bin

# Create the helper script
cat > ~/bin/docker-credential-fix.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# This is a workaround - replace with your actual Docker password if needed
echo "your-docker-password" | /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-osxkeychain "$@"
EOF

chmod +x ~/bin/docker-credential-fix.sh

# Update Docker config to use the wrapper
sed -i '' 's/"osxkeychain"/"fix"/' ~/.docker/config.json

# Create symlink
ln -s ~/bin/docker-credential-fix.sh /usr/local/bin/docker-credential-fix
```

### Solution 6: Use Docker Context (Alternative)

Switch to using Docker contexts which handle credentials differently:

```bash
docker context create mycontext --docker "host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
docker context use mycontext
```

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start with Solution 1** (code signing) - This works for most users
2. **If that fails, try Solution 2** (manual Keychain addition)
3. **Always restart your Mac** after applying Solutions 1 or 2
4. **If still having issues**, use Solution 3 temporarily while waiting for Docker updates

## Why This Happens

- macOS security changes in recent versions (especially Sonoma 14.x and Sequoia 15.x)
- Docker credential helper not properly signed or authorized
- Keychain access permissions not persisting correctly
- Known bug with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and newer macOS versions
- The "Always Allow" button sometimes fails to save the preference permanently

## Additional Tips

- Make sure Docker Desktop is up to date
- Check if you have multiple Docker installations that might conflict
- Some users report success after updating to the latest Docker Desktop version
- If using OrbStack as an alternative to Docker Desktop, this issue is also known there

## Last Resort

If none of the above solutions work, consider:

- Using Docker through a VM or container
- Using alternative tools like OrbStack or Colima
- Reporting the issue to Docker support with your specific macOS and Docker versions
