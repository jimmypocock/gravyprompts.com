# Security Fixes Implemented

This document outlines the critical security fixes implemented to prevent cost bombs and protect the API.

## 1. Anonymous View Tracking Fix

**File**: `/cdk/lambda/templates/get.js`

**Issue**: Every anonymous view was creating a DynamoDB record, which could lead to a cost bomb.

**Fix**: Modified to only track views for authenticated users:
```javascript
// Track view only for authenticated users (prevent anonymous view bombing)
if (!isOwner && userId) {
  trackView(templateId, userId).catch(console.error);
}
```

## 2. Real Rate Limiting Implementation

**File**: `/cdk/lambda-layers/shared/nodejs/utils.js`

**Issue**: The `checkRateLimit` function was a stub that always returned `true`.

**Fix**: Implemented actual rate limiting using DynamoDB:
- Tracks requests per user/IP in time windows
- Default limits:
  - List templates: 60 requests/minute
  - Get template: 100 requests/minute
  - Create template: 10 requests/minute
  - Update template: 20 requests/minute
  - Delete template: 10 requests/minute
- Uses DynamoDB with TTL for automatic cleanup
- Falls back gracefully if rate limit table doesn't exist

## 3. Rate Limiting Added to Public Endpoints

**Files**: 
- `/cdk/lambda/templates/list.js`
- `/cdk/lambda/templates/get.js`

**Implementation**:
- Added rate limit checks at the beginning of each handler
- Uses IP address for anonymous users
- Returns 429 (Too Many Requests) when limit exceeded
- All CRUD operations already had rate limiting

## 4. Request Size Limits

**File**: `/cdk/lib/api-stack.js`

**Added**:
1. Request validator for body validation
2. Request model with size constraints:
   - Title: max 200 characters
   - Content: max 50,000 characters (50KB)
   - Tags: max 10 items, 50 characters each
3. Applied to POST and PUT methods

## 5. Infrastructure Updates

**Files**:
- `/cdk/lib/api-stack.js` - Added rate limits table
- `/cdk/lib/api-waf-stack.js` - New regional WAF for API Gateway
- `/cdk/lib/app.js` - Integrated API WAF stack

**New Infrastructure**:
1. **Rate Limits Table**: DynamoDB table for tracking API requests
   - Partition key: `pk` (e.g., "RATE#userId#action")
   - Sort key: `sk` (e.g., "WINDOW#timestamp")
   - TTL enabled for automatic cleanup

2. **Regional WAF for API Gateway**:
   - IP-based rate limiting: 100 requests/5 minutes
   - Request size limit: 100KB max body size
   - AWS Managed Rules for common threats
   - Associated directly with API Gateway

## 6. WAF Protection

**File**: `/cdk/lib/api-waf-stack.js`

**Features**:
- IP-based rate limiting at WAF level (defense in depth)
- Request body size constraint (100KB max)
- AWS Managed Rules with exclusions for legitimate API traffic
- CloudWatch metrics for monitoring

## Deployment Steps

1. Deploy the backend stacks:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:backend
   ```

2. The deployment will create:
   - Rate limits DynamoDB table
   - Regional WAF for API Gateway
   - Request validators on API methods

## Monitoring

- Rate limit violations are logged to CloudWatch
- WAF blocks are tracked in CloudWatch metrics
- 429 responses indicate rate limiting is working

## Cost Protection

These fixes provide multiple layers of protection:
1. No anonymous view tracking = No DynamoDB writes for anonymous users
2. Rate limiting = Prevents abuse of authenticated endpoints
3. WAF = Blocks malicious traffic before it reaches Lambda
4. Request size limits = Prevents large payload attacks

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing CAPTCHA for anonymous users
2. Add API keys for better tracking and control
3. Implement more sophisticated rate limiting (e.g., by endpoint)
4. Add DDoS protection with AWS Shield Advanced
