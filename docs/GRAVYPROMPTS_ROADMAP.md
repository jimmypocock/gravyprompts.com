# GravyPrompts Platform Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for GravyPrompts as a comprehensive AI prompt templating engine, inspired by Mailchimp's email template system but tailored specifically for AI/LLM workflows.

## Executive Summary

GravyPrompts will be the "Mailchimp for AI Prompts" - a platform that enables users to create, manage, share, and monetize AI prompt templates. Just as Mailchimp revolutionized email marketing with templates and merge tags, GravyPrompts will simplify AI prompt creation with dynamic variables, conditional logic, and team collaboration features.
