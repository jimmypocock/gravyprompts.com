# Security Audit Log

This document maintains a historical record of security issues identified and resolved in the GravyPrompts application.

## 2024 Security Audit & Fixes

### Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

#### 1. Anonymous View Tracking DDoS Vulnerability
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Issue**: Every page view by anonymous users created DynamoDB records, allowing potential DDoS attacks that could incur massive costs
- **Fix**: Removed anonymous view tracking entirely; views now only tracked for authenticated users
- **Files Modified**: `cdk/lambda/templates/get.js`

#### 2. Missing Rate Limiting
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Issue**: No rate limiting on any endpoints, allowing unlimited requests
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive rate limiting with different limits for authenticated/anonymous users
- **Files Modified**: `cdk/lambda-layers/shared/nodejs/utils.js`
- **Configuration**: 100 req/min (anonymous), 1000 req/min (authenticated)

#### 3. Unbounded List Responses
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Severity**: High
- **Issue**: List endpoints returned full template content, causing large response sizes
- **Fix**: Modified to return only metadata, reducing response size by 80-90%
- **Files Modified**: `cdk/lambda/templates/list.js`

#### 4. AWS Comprehend Infinite Loop
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Issue**: Misconfigured Comprehend integration caused $100+ charges in infinite loop
- **Fix**: Completely removed AWS Comprehend, replaced with local content moderation
- **Files Modified**: Multiple Lambda functions, removed Comprehend dependency
- **Cost Impact**: Eliminated ongoing Comprehend charges

#### 5. Hardcoded Debug URLs
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Issue**: Debug scripts contained hardcoded production API URLs
- **Fix**: Removed debug scripts, created secure alternatives with environment variables
- **Files Removed**: Multiple debug-*.js scripts

### Infrastructure Security Enhancements

#### WAF Deployment
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Implementation**: AWS WAF with managed rule sets
- **Protection Against**: SQL injection, XSS, known bad IPs
- **Cost**: ~$60/month
- **Stack**: `GRAVYPROMPTS-WAF`

#### Budget Monitoring
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Implementation**: AWS Budgets with email alerts
- **Thresholds**: Daily ($5), Monthly ($50), Per-service limits
- **Stack**: `GRAVYPROMPTS-Budget`

#### CloudWatch Dashboards
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive monitoring dashboard
- **Metrics**: API latency, Lambda errors, DynamoDB usage, costs
- **Stack**: `GRAVYPROMPTS-ComprehensiveMonitoring`

### Authentication & Authorization Fixes

#### CI/CD Authentication
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Issue**: Using long-lived AWS access keys in GitHub Actions
- **Fix**: Migrated to OIDC authentication with temporary credentials
- **Impact**: Eliminated risk of credential exposure

#### Admin Endpoint Protection
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Enhancement**: Added explicit admin role checking
- **Endpoints Protected**: `/admin/*`, approval endpoints
- **Implementation**: Cognito groups with "admin" role

### Script Security Audit

#### Script Cleanup
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Issue**: 98 scripts with various security concerns
- **Action**: Reduced to 51 essential scripts
- **Removed**: Debug scripts, one-off tools, scripts with hardcoded values

#### Secure Configuration Loading
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Issue**: Insecure environment variable loading in shell scripts
- **Fix**: Implemented secure sourcing with proper error handling
- **Files Modified**: `scripts/config.sh`

## Security Improvements Timeline

### Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (Completed)
- ✅ Disable anonymous view tracking
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Reduce API response sizes
- ✅ Remove AWS Comprehend

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Hardening (Completed)
- ✅ Deploy WAF
- ✅ Set up budget alerts
- ✅ Create monitoring dashboards
- ✅ Implement OIDC for CI/CD

### Phase 3: Ongoing Enhancements (In Progress)
- ⏳ Lambda concurrency limits
- ⏳ Dead letter queues
- ⏳ X-Ray tracing
- ⏳ Enhanced cost controls

## Lessons Learned

1. **Cost Management**: Always implement cost controls before deploying AWS services
2. **Rate Limiting**: Essential for any public-facing API
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive dashboards are crucial for security visibility
4. **Least Privilege**: Start with minimal permissions and expand as needed
5. **Code Review**: Security issues often hide in debug and utility scripts

## Security Metrics

### Before Security Audit
- Rate limiting: ❌ None
- WAF protection: ❌ None
- Cost controls: ❌ None
- Monitoring: ❌ Basic
- Anonymous tracking: ❌ Unlimited

### After Security Audit
- Rate limiting: ✅ Implemented
- WAF protection: ✅ Active
- Cost controls: ✅ Multiple layers
- Monitoring: ✅ Comprehensive
- Anonymous tracking: ✅ Disabled

## Future Security Considerations

1. **API Gateway Throttling**: Additional rate limiting at API Gateway level
2. **AWS Shield Advanced**: For DDoS protection (if traffic warrants)
3. **Security Hub**: Centralized security findings
4. **GuardDuty**: Threat detection service
5. **Regular Penetration Testing**: Annual security assessments

## Incident Response History

No security incidents reported since implementing security enhancements.
