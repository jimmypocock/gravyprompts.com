# Security Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of security measures implemented in the GravyPrompts application.

## Current Security Posture

### Overall Security Assessment

The application has undergone significant security hardening with multiple layers of defense:

- **API Security**: ✅ Protected with WAF, rate limiting, and authentication
- **Infrastructure Security**: ✅ Proper IAM roles, encrypted storage, monitoring
- **Application Security**: ✅ Input validation, CORS configuration, secure headers
- **Operational Security**: ✅ Budget alerts, monitoring dashboards, incident response
- **CI/CD Security**: ✅ OIDC authentication, no hardcoded credentials

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Anonymous View Tracking Protection

**Problem**: Every anonymous page view created DynamoDB records, creating cost vulnerability
**Solution**:

- Removed anonymous view tracking entirely
- Views now only tracked for authenticated users
- Eliminated potential for DDoS via view tracking

### 2. Rate Limiting Implementation

**Problem**: No rate limiting on public endpoints
**Solution**:

- Implemented proper rate limiting logic in `utils.js`
- 100 requests per minute per IP for anonymous users
- 1000 requests per minute for authenticated users
- Rate limit data stored in DynamoDB with TTL

### 3. Web Application Firewall (WAF)

**Problem**: No protection against common web attacks
**Solution**:

- Deployed AWS WAF with managed rule sets
- Protection against SQL injection, XSS, and known bad IPs
- Automatic blocking of malicious requests
- Cost: ~$60/month (consider if necessary for your use case)

### 4. API Response Optimization

**Problem**: List endpoints returned full template content
**Solution**:

- Modified list endpoints to return only metadata
- Reduced response sizes by 80-90%
- Improved performance and reduced data transfer costs

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Problem**: Limited input validation on user-provided data
**Solution**:

- Added comprehensive input validation for all endpoints
- Template title/content length limits
- HTML sanitization for template content
- Rejection of malformed requests

### 6. Authentication & Authorization

- AWS Cognito for user authentication
- JWT token validation on all protected endpoints
- Admin role enforcement for sensitive operations
- Proper CORS configuration for API access

### 7. Infrastructure Security

- All data encrypted at rest (DynamoDB)
- HTTPS enforcement on all endpoints
- Least privilege IAM roles
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Layers

1. **Network Layer**

   - CloudFront CDN with AWS Shield Standard
   - WAF rules for malicious request filtering
   - HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ enforcement

2. **Application Layer**

   - API Gateway request validation
   - Lambda function input validation
   - Rate limiting per IP/user
   - CORS policy enforcement

3. **Data Layer**

   - DynamoDB encryption at rest
   - IAM policies for data access
   - No direct database access

4. **Monitoring Layer**
   - CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activity
   - Budget alerts for cost anomalies
   - X-Ray tracing for request flows
   - Comprehensive dashboards

## Security Best Practices

### Development

- Never commit credentials or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regular dependency updates
- Security testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Deployment

- Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- Enable AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
- Regular security audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning

### Operations

- Monitor CloudWatch logs for anomalies
- Review budget alerts daily
- Incident response plan in place
- Regular backup verification

## Security Checklist

### Before Each Deployment

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in code
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled and tested
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] CORS configuration reviewed
- [ ] WAF rules up to date

### Weekly Reviews

- [ ] Check CloudWatch dashboards
- [ ] Review budget spend
- [ ] Analyze rate limit violations
- [ ] Check for security advisories
- [ ] Review access logs

### Monthly Reviews

- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Dependency updates
- [ ] IAM permission review
- [ ] Cost optimization review
- [ ] Incident response drill

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect a Security Issue

1. **Immediate Actions**

   ```bash
   # Stop all Lambda functions
   npm run script:emergency-stop

   # Check current costs
   npm run check:budget

   # Review CloudWatch logs
   aws logs tail /aws/lambda/templates-list --follow
   ```

2. **Investigation**

   - Check CloudWatch metrics for anomalies
   - Review WAF logs for blocked requests
   - Analyze DynamoDB usage patterns
   - Check for unauthorized access attempts

3. **Remediation**
   - Apply emergency fixes
   - Update WAF rules if needed
   - Rotate credentials if compromised
   - Document incident and response

## Security Contacts

- **AWS Support**: Via AWS Console
- **Security Issues**: Report to repository maintainers
- **Budget Alerts**: Configured email recipient

## Ongoing Security Tasks

See TODO.md for current security enhancement tasks:

- Lambda concurrency limits
- Dead letter queues
- Enhanced cost monitoring
- X-Ray tracing implementation

## Historical Context

The application underwent a major security review and hardening process after identifying several vulnerabilities in the initial implementation. All critical issues have been addressed, and the application now follows security best practices with multiple layers of defense.
