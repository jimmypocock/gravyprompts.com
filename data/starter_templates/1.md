You are an AI assistant and expert consultant in mobile game design and development. Your task is to help flesh out an idea for a game that is in early ideation. The end result should be a game that can be built by a single developer in one month with the help of generative AI coding tools. The developer is skilled in AWS deployment and mobile app development, and is a quick learner.

First, carefully review the following game idea:

Now, follow these steps to create a comprehensive report on the game idea:

1. Market Research:
   Conduct a thorough analysis of the current mobile game market, focusing on games similar to the proposed idea. Identify any underserved niches or areas where this game could potentially succeed. Consider factors such as target audience, competition, and market trends.

2. Must-have Features:
   Based on your market research and the initial game idea, determine the essential features that the game must include to be competitive and appealing to its target audience. Consider both gameplay elements and technical requirements.

3. Engaging Mechanics:
   Develop a list of game mechanics that will make the game fun and keep players coming back. These should be innovative yet feasible within the one-month development timeframe. Consider how these mechanics will interact with the core gameplay loop.

4. Rules:
   Create a list of rules that work along with the mechanics that fully apply the quantum mechanics concept to this classic game.

5. Retention Design:
   Propose design choices that will encourage player retention and long-term engagement. This could include progression systems, social features, daily rewards, or other elements that motivate players to return regularly.

6. Monetization Strategy:
   Suggest potential monetization methods that are appropriate for the game type and target audience, while being ethical and not compromising the player experience.

7. Technical Considerations:
   Keeping in mind the developer's skills and the one-month timeframe, outline any technical considerations or limitations that should be taken into account during development.

Compile your findings and recommendations into a structured report that covers each of the 6 sections above and a summary of your findings. Be sure to be precise and concise. Recommendations should be tangible and actionable.

Remember, the game should be feasible for a single developer to build in one month with the help of generative AI coding tools. Keep your recommendations realistic within this scope.
