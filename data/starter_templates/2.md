Create a detailed development plan for [[GAME_NAME]] with both single-player and multiplayer modes. Include the following sections:

1. Game Mechanics:
   - Core rules: Explain how traditional poker is enhanced with quantum mechanics concepts
   - Card superposition system: How cards exist in multiple states until "observed"
   - AI opponent implementation for single-player mode
   - Multiplayer session management ensuring consistent rules
   - Hand rankings and winning conditions
2. Technical Architecture:
   - AWS backend services:
     - DynamoDB for user profiles and game state
     - Lambda functions for game logic
     - AppSync for real-time multiplayer functionality
     - Cognito for user authentication
   - Mobile implementation using React Native or Flutter
   - Data flow diagrams and state management approach
   - Detailed SAM template for AWS deployment
3. Development Timeline:
   - Week 1: Core gameplay and single-player logic
   - Week 2: Card mechanics and UI implementation
   - Week 3: AWS backend and multiplayer functionality
   - Week 4: Polish, testing, and deployment
4. Monetization Strategy:
   - Free basic game with limited daily plays
   - Premium card designs and table themes
   - Tournament entry fees and structure
   - Non-intrusive ad implementation
5. Generative AI Integration:
   - AI opponent using trained ML models on AWS SageMaker
   - Card art generation using Stable Diffusion or similar
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on player skill
6. Technical Documentation:
   _ README.md with setup instructions
   _ API documentation for multiplayer integration \* Deployment guide for AWS resources
   Include code snippets for key components: card state management system, game logic for quantum effects, and AWS service integration examples.
