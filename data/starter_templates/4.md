You are tasked with reviewing a website (found here: [[WEBSITE_LINK]]), then research other applications, feedback, and resources that are similar in target market and function. Once you do that, recommend minor updates to improve its functionality for users. Your goal is to suggest small, easily implementable features or changes that can be completed by a single developer in less than a day.

Analyze the website's current features, user interface, and overall functionality. Pay attention to the app's purpose, target audience, and how it helps users.

Next, consider the research on similar apps.

Compare the features and functionality of these similar apps with this one. Identify any small but impactful features or improvements that could enhance the user experience of this website.

Based on your analysis, recommend 3-5 minor updates or new features that could be implemented quickly (in less than a day by a single developer). Focus on suggestions such as:

- Small UI/UX improvements
- Minor functionality enhancements
- Usability tweaks
- Simple additions that align with the app's core purpose

Ensure that your recommendations are:

1. Easily implementable
2. Aligned with the app's main purpose
3. Beneficial for musicians or other types of users of all ages and experience levels
4. Not major releases or entirely new products

For each recommendation, provide:

1. A brief description of the update or new feature
2. The rationale behind the suggestion
3. How it would benefit the users

Present your final recommendations in the following format:

1. [Feature/Update Name]

   - Description: [Brief description of the feature or update]
   - Rationale: [Reason for suggesting this improvement]
   - User Benefit: [How this will help users using the app]

2. [Feature/Update Name]
   - Description: [Brief description of the feature or update]
   - Rationale: [Reason for suggesting this improvement]
   - User Benefit: [How this will help users using the app]
