Research and compile a list of potential side hustle opportunities. Consider the following sources:\n\n   - Online marketplaces (e.g., Amazon, Etsy, eBay)\n   - Freelancing platforms (e.g., Upwork, Fiverr)\n   - Sharing economy platforms (e.g., Airbnb, Turo)\n   - Digital product creation and distribution\n   - Passive income streams (e.g., affiliate marketing, dropshipping)\n   - â€¦any others you find in your research.\n\n3. Evaluate each potential side hustle based on the following criteria:\n\n   - Legality: Ensure all suggestions are legal in most jurisdictions\n   - Time commitment: Should require only a few hours per week\n   - Initial investment: Should require at most a small upfront investment\n   - Risk level: Should have relatively low risk\n   - Longevity: Can be maintained over a long period of time\n   - Income potential: Should have the potential to generate consistent income\n\n4.

Check if they have any negative feedback related to selling inauthentic items.\n   c. Look for any eBay badges or certifications the seller may have.\n   d. Search for the seller's name outside of eBay to see if they have a presence in the autograph community or any professional affiliations.\n\n2. Evaluate the authenticity of the item:\n   a. Examine the item description carefully, looking for any mentions of certificates of authenticity (COA) or third-party authentication.\n   b. Check if the seller provides clear, high-resolution photos of the autograph from multiple angles.\n   c. Look for any statements about the item's provenance or history.\n   d. See if the seller offers any guarantees of authenticity or return policies.\n   e. Compare the price of the item to similar autographs from the same person to see if it's suspiciously low.\n\n3.

Suggest next steps:\n   Provide suggestions for what the buyer should do next. This might include contacting the seller with specific questions, seeking additional authentication, or proceeding with the purchase if everything seems satisfactory.\n\nRemember to be thorough in your research and clear in your presentation of findings and recommendations.

Your goal is to research Minesweeper, analyze legal considerations, and suggest ways to differentiate a new game from the original, that would also recapture the hearts and minds of game lovers.\n\nFirst, review the following links related to Minesweeper:\n\n[[LINKS]]\n\nNow, carefully read through these links and any other reputable sources you can find to gather information about Minesweeper. Pay special attention to:\n\n1. The game's history and original creators\n2. Gameplay mechanics and rules\n3. Visual design elements\n4. Any known copyrights, trademarks, or patents associated with the game\n\nNext, analyze the legal considerations for creating a Minesweeper-like game. Consider:\n\n1. What elements of Minesweeper are likely protected by copyright or trademark?\n2. What aspects of the game are considered public domain or common game mechanics?\n3. Are there any known legal precedents related to Minesweeper clones or similar games?\n4. This is a mobile game, so how does that help with what we're doing\n\nThen, brainstorm ideas to differentiate the new game from Minesweeper. Consider:\n\n1. Unique gameplay mechanics that could be added or modified\n2. Visual design changes that would set the game apart\n3. Thematic alterations that could give the game a distinct identity\n4. Customization options or features that could enhance the player experience\n\nBased on your research and analysis, provide your recommendations on:\n1. Legal Considerations: Discuss what elements can and cannot be safely used in the new game without risking legal issues.\n2. Differentiation Strategies: Suggest at least three specific ways to make the game distinct from Minesweeper, considering gameplay, visuals, and theme.\n3. Development Advice: Provide guidance on how to implement the suggested changes without significantly increasing development costs or time.\n4. Final Assessment: Offer a brief conclusion on the viability of releasing the game as described, and any final recommendations for proceeding with the project.\n\nEnsure your advice is clear, concise, and actionable for the game developer.",

The user has very little design experience and no budget. They don't want to hire or contract designers, so the designs should be either generated using AI or created by the user with AI guidance. Your goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis and recommendations for creating assets such as characters, items, backgrounds, etc., for the following games:\n\n<games>\n[[GAMES]]\n</games>\n\nAll five games listed in <games> are for iOS and Android. React Native will be used but the rest of the technology is up in the air.\n\nTo complete this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the game list:\n\n   - Identify common themes or asset types across the games\n   - Note any unique or specific asset requirements for each game\n\n2. Research asset creation options:\n\n   - Investigate generative AI tools suitable for game asset creation\n   - Explore DIY design methods that can be guided by AI\n   - Consider free or low-cost resources for game assets\n\n3. Evaluate the pros and cons of each approach:\n\n   - Generative AI: Ease of use, quality of output, customization options\n   - DIY with AI guidance: Learning curve, time investment, level of control\n   - Free resources: Availability, quality, licensing considerations\n\n4. Consider the user's limitations:\n\n   - Little design experience\n   - No budget\n   - Time constraints (if mentioned)\n\n5. Develop recommendations:\n\n   - Suggest the most suitable approach for each asset type (characters, items, backgrounds, etc.)\n   - Provide specific tool recommendations or DIY methods\n   - Outline a step-by-step process for asset creation\n\n6. Address potential challenges:\n\n   - Identify possible obstacles in the asset creation process\n   - Suggest solutions or workarounds for these challenges\n\n7. Provide additional resources:\n   - List tutorials, guides, or communities that can support the user's asset creation journey\n\nPresent your analysis and recommendations in a structured format\n\n- Include your detailed analysis of the games, asset requirements, and creation options here\n- Provide your specific recommendations for the best path forward, including tools, methods, and step-by-step processes\n- Discuss potential challenges and suggested solutions\n- List additional resources to support the user's asset creation process\n\nEnsure that your response is comprehensive, well-organized, and tailored to the user's specific needs and limitations.

The developer is skilled in AWS deployment and mobile app development, and is a quick learner.\n\nFirst, carefully review the following game idea:\n\n<game_idea>\n[[GAME_IDEA]]\n</game_idea>\n\nNow, follow these steps to create a comprehensive report on the game idea:\n\n1. Market Research:\n   Conduct a thorough analysis of the current mobile game market, focusing on games similar to the proposed idea. Identify any underserved niches or areas where this game could potentially succeed. Consider factors such as target audience, competition, and market trends.\n\n2. Must-have Features:\n   Based on your market research and the initial game idea, determine the essential features that the game must include to be competitive and appealing to its target audience. Consider both gameplay elements and technical requirements.\n\n3. Engaging Mechanics:\n   Develop a list of game mechanics that will make the game fun and keep players coming back. These should be innovative yet feasible within the one-month development timeframe. Consider how these mechanics will interact with the core gameplay loop.\n\n4. Rules:\n   Create a list of rules that work along with the mechanics that fully apply the quantum mechanics concept to this classic game.\n\n5. Retention Design:\n   Propose design choices that will encourage player retention and long-term engagement. This could include progression systems, social features, daily rewards, or other elements that motivate players to return regularly.\n\n6. Monetization Strategy:\n   Suggest potential monetization methods that are appropriate for the game type and target audience, while being ethical and not compromising the player experience.\n\n7. Technical Considerations:\n   Keeping in mind the developer's skills and the one-month timeframe, outline any technical considerations or limitations that should be taken into account during development.\n\nCompile your findings and recommendations into a structured report that covers each of the 6 sections above and a summary of your findings. Be sure to be precise and concise. Recommendations should be tangible and actionable.\n\nRemember, the game should be feasible for a single developer to build in one month with the help of generative AI coding tools.
